This is a macro-pad project based on arduino pro micro.

It utilze the HID funcionality of the pro-micro to simulate keyboard keys.
the key assignments are F13-F21 as these keys are not used by default and are not present on the keyboard layout.

Keyboard Matrix:
 -----------------
| F13 | F14 | F15 |
| F16 | F17 | F18 |
| F19 | F20 | F21 |
 -----------------

The functionality of each key is assigned in a python script.
